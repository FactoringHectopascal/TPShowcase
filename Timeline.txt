This is an archive of my workflow, this is the timeline I used to create this Top Down Showcase;
It's readability is suboptimal to anyone except for me, and even I had to switch around my priorities a few times.
- Create A Main Menu (Complete)
- Create A Basic Scene for the Main Menu to load. (Done)
- Basic Player Character (Done)
- Enemy Prefab (Add Health, Shooting, etc.) (Done)
- Test/Add Win/Lose Conditions (Complete)
- Pause Menu (Complete)
- Health Bar/Other UI elements like Stamina (Health Bar Complete, Enemy Health Bar Complete)
- Create A Second Scene & Condition to move on to a second level (Done)
- Create Art/Dev Art (Done)
- Adding Animation to player character and enemies (Done, no gunfire animation.)
- Start Designing First Level (Done)
- Start Designing Second Level (Done)
- Other Mechanics, Dashing, Bomb. (Done)
Archive Over

I have added in this showcase:
- Two unique levels with different tilesets.
- Three unique enemys, all containing different accuracies, firerates, health values & drops.
- Powerup drops, which all do different things.
- Dashing with Iframes with a working cooldown.
- A bomb with working cooldown.
- A boss that summons minions with a working cooldown and enemy limit.
- An enemy counter that loads the next level when there are no enemies.
- Working main menu, pause menu, Lose menu, and Win menu.
- A lot of spaghetti.

What Hit The Cutting Room Floor:
- Health Regen
- Enemy Counter UI
- Asteroids
- Some Tiles
- Gunfire Animation
- Stamina

Why Did These Things Not Make It? :
Health Regen - I thought that adding a health regen would be unnecessary, and would disrupt the balance of the game.
Especially considering that there are medkit drops that ships will drop for you, it all felt unnecessary. I thought it wouldn't be a good use
of my time, and instead I could use my time for things like implementing the dodge.
Enemy Counter UI - Honestly, I was feeling lazy. I could add this if I wanted to, but with all the work I've done on this project,
I feel I have something I'm proud of, and that any more adjustments might just cost me extra time when I'm already done with the thing and so
inundated with other assigments.
Asteroids - How would I even implement this? A spawning script that spawns an asteroid that follows you and hits you and breaks unless you shoot it?
Sure, that sounds kind of cool, but honesty I wasn't trying to fall prey to feature creep anymore than I already was with a SHOWCASE. This is a learning game.
This isn't anything that people are going to be playing at the moment, this is a showcase of my current technical skill and my ability to learn and apply things
within C# and Unity. I feel like I'm proud enough with the current mechanics of my showcase. I might add asteroids on my spare time, but as it currently stands it won't 
make it into the cut I'm going to be presenting. Also, I'm just feeling kind of burnt out. I have a burning passion for coding, but I have literally been programming nonstop
for like a week without any recreation. I want to play video games, too.
Unused Sprites In My Tilesets - Some of them hurt my eyes to look at, especially if it was a repeating tile with color. It didn't look good, at all. So, I opted for something
more subtle. Thankfully, my class doesn't judge my artistic ability; I feel like I can make something decent in pixel art, but I'm not a master. So the subtle tiles I add
look nice enough.
Gunfire Animation - A gunfire animation would've looked cool, and I might still implement it on my own time after I show my project to my teacher. But, as it currently stands,
I know neither how to make it look nice, or if it's a good use of my time to do so when I'm so overwhelmed with other assignments.
Stamina - It would've been a decent thing to implement. However, I didn't want to implement it. There's a reason Dante doesn't have a stamina bar, and he doesn't have to retreat from enemies to
recover. I think this isn't that kind of game. In games like Dark Souls, it makes sense. It games like Devil May Cry, it wouldn't really.
